# Sound in Motion Workshop  

This repository contains interactive sound examples created for the [Sound in Motion Workshop](https://www.udk-berlin.de/universitaet/online-lehre-an-der-universitaet-der-kuenste-berlin/inkuele/31-march-3-april-workshop-sound-in-motion/).  

## Overview  

The sound examples demonstrate various approaches to motion-based sound interaction using different software environments and sensor inputs.  

### Software Environments  
The examples are available in:  
- **Ableton Live Suite**  
- **Ableton Live Lite**  
- **SuperCollider**  

### Sensor Inputs  
These examples utilize motion and contact-based sensor data, including:  
- **Smartphone accelerometers** – capturing movement data from mobile devices  
- **Kinect camera** – tracking body movements and gestures  
- **Oddball** – a motion-sensitive musical device  
- **Contact microphones** – detecting vibrations and surface interactions  

## Usage  
Download the appropriate files for your preferred software and explore how movement influences sound generation and processing.
